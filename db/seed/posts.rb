<p><strong>Other Volunteer:</strong> People who have tickets already, and plan to work at least one volunteer shift, but don't fit into one of the other categories.</p>

You must pay in order to get a confirmed reservation. You must send your payment before the payment deadline (July 20) or we will release your hold on the room.</p>
<p>Some of the rooms have space for as many as 6 people**, so you can organize a group, have one person register for the room, and split up the room however you wish. Once you have registered and paid for a room, any room changes or cost sharing are the responsibility of the group.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: the person who reserves the room will be responsible for making sure guests in the room follow all <strong><a href="../../rules">cabin rules</a></strong>, paying for any damages that may occur and <strong>removing all trash</strong>. The FnF campout is a pack in and pack out event and this applies to the cabins as well. Trash cans are only provided to help you collect your garbage before you pack it out.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">* The notable exception: In the Main Cabin, there are three dormitory-style rooms with multiple twin bunk beds. For these rooms, you register by the bed, and you may register for more than one bed.<br /><br />** Assuming 2 people to a double or queen bed and 1 person to a twin.</p>'

Please check the <strong><a href="../../faq">FAQ</a></strong> for payment options other than the PayPal button at check-out.</p>
<p>Please remember that a non-paid registration only lasts until July 20. If we have not received your payment before then, we will cancel your registration and make your lodging available for other participants.</p>
